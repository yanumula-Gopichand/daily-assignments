# control statements:list of statements executed sequentially we

#while loop: it is used to repeatedly execute a block of statements
# for loop: for loop is used to iterate a sequence of items
#transfer statements:
#break: to exit out of the loop the statements after break can not execute
#continue: jumps the current itteration to the begin of the loop
#pass: we don't have any statements we can use pass keyword or we don't adda ny methods or functions we can 
#use pass
